Matching card game
Instructions:
We’re looking for two hours of your best work in implementing a solution for the exercise below. Feel free to use what you most feel comfortable with.
Part 1:
Build an interactive application that let’s a single player match sets of 2 cards in a matching game.
Requirements:
● The game consists of a regular 52 card deck
● To start a game, the cards are randomly shuffled and placed on a game board ● A user can:
○ turn cards over
○ choose 2 cards per “turn” from the board
■ if the card values match (ignoring suit), the cards are removed from the game board
■ if not, cards are returned to the game board in their previous positions
○ view successfully matched pairs of cards
○ can count how many matched pairs they have found ● Other requirements
○ The cards on the board maintain their initial location on the board when other cards are removed
○ Game completes when all pairs have been found
Part 2:
Integrate a 2 player turn based system with a “computer” player.
Requirements:
● The game can distinguish between the turns of two players
● The game keeps a count of the matched pairs for each player
● A single user’s turn may continue if they successfully match a pair ● The computer can:
○ select cards from the board
○ “remember” the values of cards that have previously turned over
○ choose cards off the board based upon it’s knowledge of the board
